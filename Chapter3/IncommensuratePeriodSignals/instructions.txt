Hi David

here the tracking/disturbance rejection with incommensurate periods

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/58656755/GenSignalFourierDec/C44/IncommensuratePeriodSignals.zip

it works very-very well.

All the signal decompositions are done in Matlab now.
I clean all solutions to make it small.

To get all solution just run
study 1
study 2
study 3

if you want to change some parameters then:

change parameters
run study1
save the probes in G.txt
run Get_G_Inverse from matlab (no arguments)
load the file G_Inverse.txt in variable 1
run study2
save the probes in data.txt
run Get_Gamma(kmax,nmax,lmax) from matlab (right it is Get_Gamma(20,3,4))
load the fila Gamma.txt in variable2
run study3
Enjoy the results!

Best
Eugenio
